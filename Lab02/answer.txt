Questions and answers:
10. Create Construction Method
    * If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
    - No, JAVA won't allow me to do so. Because those two methods have the same name and the same parameter:
        public DVD(String str) {
            this.str = str;
        }
    JAVA can't distinguish between them.

14. Working with method overloading
    * Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd.
    Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
    - I prefer to use an array parameter. Because it's easier to understand and more convenient to use.
    I don't have to write down all DVDs at once. Instead, I can pass just an array of DVD objects.

15. Passing parameter
    *  Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
    - Technically, Java is always pass by value, because even though a variable might hold a reference to an object,
    that object reference is a value that represents the object's location in memory. Object references are therefore passed by value.

    * After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
    - Because the swap method only swaps the values of the two parameters, not the objects themselves. The objects
    still have the same values as before.

    * After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
    - Because the changeTitle method changes the title of the object that is passed as a parameter by method setTitle().

    * Please write a swap() method that can correctly swap the two objects.
    - I have written the swapTitle() method in the TestPassingParameter class:
        public static void swapTitle(DigitalVideoDisc dvd1, DigitalVideoDisc dvd2) {
            String tmp = dvd1.getTitle();
            dvd1.setTitle(dvd2.getTitle());
            dvd2.setTitle(tmp);
        }
    Using setTitle() method to change the titles of two objects to affect the objects' values, not just the parameters.
