6.1:
1. What happens if users choose “Cancel”?
    If the users select "Cancel", the variable 'option' will receive value 2 before being compared with 'JOptionPane.YES_OPTION',
    which has value 1. Because 2 does not equal to 1, the program will show the 'No' message on the screen as if users chose 'No'.

2. How to customize the options to users, e.g. only two options: “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do” and “I don’t”
